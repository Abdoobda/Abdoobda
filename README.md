# Abderrahmane Boukhelif

**Software Engineer** | **Full-Stack Developer** | **AI & Reinforcement Learning Enthusiast** | **Freelance @ GiesCode**

I’m a Master's graduate in Software Engineering from Saad Dahlab University of Blida, with practical experience in full-stack development, intelligent systems, and freelance web projects through GiesCode.

I enjoy building useful and user-friendly software solutions, whether for clients or as part of academic and personal projects. My work bridges the gap between software engineering and AI, with a strong focus on creating tools that solve real-world problems.

I’m currently open to freelance work, internships, or junior developer roles where I can contribute, grow, and collaborate on meaningful, tech-driven projects.
